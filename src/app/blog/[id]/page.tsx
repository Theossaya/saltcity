    title: "The Art of Expectation",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">In the faith journey, many have professed with their mouths what their hearts do not believe. They do this mainly to participate in the tradition or norm of their local church or to be recognized as positive talkers.</p>

      <p>Many people speak 'Christianese,' but their hearts may not understand the language. Until your subconscious is in an expectant state, you will not receive it.</p>

      <p>Some are not expectant because they don't believe it will come. Worse are those who believe it will or can happen for others but not for them. This feeling continues to dim our faith lamp indirectly by crushing our expectations from GOD.</p>

      <h2>The Agricultural Illustration</h2>
      <p>A farmer who invests hours into tilling his land does so with the expectation that there will be a harvest. The same agricultural illustration is brought to our notice in I Corinthians 9:10: "...he that ploughs ought to be ploughing in expectation, and; he that threshes should be a partaker of his expectation."</p>

      <h2>Understanding Biblical Expectation</h2>
      <p>Of the three Greek words translated in the New Testament by "expect," prosdokao, meaning to look forward toward what will probably occur, whether in hope or dread (Acts 3:5; Luke 3:15), is not as intense as ekdechomai (Hebrews 10:13), meaning to wait for the realization of what one is assured of ("as the husbandman waits for the processes of Nature (James 5:7), and the patriarchs for the Divine promise," Westcott), or as vivid as the noun apokaradokia (Romans 8:19; Philippians 1:20, "earnest expectation"), which describes the stretching forth of the head toward an anticipated object.</p>

      <p>Most of what I am writing about today concerns the verb, 'ekdechomai.' There is something about its meaning that says 'it must happen.' Expectations keep us in a steady place of readiness. Expectation fosters hope. Hope is the most essential tool in any journey. It's an anchor that hooks you to the coming good. The expectation is the small voice that says, "It is going to happen to me."</p>

      <h2>Expecting the Best</h2>
      <p>People often spend their lives wondering: What is the worst thing that could happen to me? They fill their minds with this, and it influences their whole life. Now, what can go wrong today? This has gone wrong, that has gone wrong, there must be a third disaster somewhere! And they usually get what they expect — the worst. But what does the Bible teach?</p>

      <p>The Bible teaches that we should expect the best. Here again is an area where we must adjust our thinking to align with God's Word. If we are going to see the promised result, it will not come by expecting the worst, but by expecting the best. Always expect the best!</p>

      <h2>The Lesson from Paul's Shipwreck</h2>
      <p>In Acts chapter 27, there is a record of the shipwreck during Paul's enforced journey to Rome. After describing the fury of the hurricane battering the ship, the Bible recounts how the people onboard had their eyes on the circumstances around them: no sun or stars to guide them, just the tempest blowing day after day, and they lost all expectations. When they looked at this situation, the record states that all expectation of being saved was then taken away. Who took it away? They did — they removed it from their minds.</p>

      <p>Look at verse 25 (this is Paul speaking): "Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: For I believe GOD..." Be of good cheer? That shows expectation!</p>

      <h2>Rejoicing in Expectation</h2>
      <p>Romans 12:12 gives a vital key to understanding expectation. The first clause of this verse is packed with truth: "Rejoice in expectation." Rejoicing is a repeated experience of joy.</p>

      <p>It's also about being so excited about what you are about to receive that you're on tiptoe waiting for it to arrive. This enthusiasm is not based on outside circumstances but by renewing our minds to the greatness of GOD's Word.</p>

      <p>It's not about sitting there with a straight face and a sour look, saying, "Yes, I'm expecting the answer." There's rejoicing in expectation; there's a thrill because you see the Word come alive.</p>

      <h2>God: The God of Expectation</h2>
      <p>Romans 15:13 declares GOD to be "the GOD of expectation." GOD is characterized by this attitude of expectation. "Now the GOD of expectation fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in expectation..."</p>

      <p>To abound means to be overabundant in number or measure. Expectation isn't just saying every morning, "Today is the day," then forgetting about it the rest of the day. This verse encourages rejoicing, abounding, and enthusiasm — it becomes a true expectation.</p>

      <p>Expectation is definitely not dull or serious! Rejoicing in expectation means having some emotion involved. You bring the excitement — the expectation.</p>

      <h2>Holding Fast Our Confession</h2>
      <p>How do we show our expectations? Notice Hebrews 10:23: "Let us hold fast the confession of our expectation without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised)." Two things are clear: first, it is possible to waver.</p>

      <p>It's very possible because others around you will try to sway you from the Word—that's satan at work. Don't waver!</p>

      <p>Protection from wavering doesn't come automatically at salvation; it takes effort. You and I have the privilege of deciding whether to hold fast. It's a powerful truth because God has never asked you to do anything impossible.</p>

      <p>The word "confession" here is a translation of the Greek word homologia—homo means "like" and logia comes from logos, "a word or saying." Confession isn't what we usually understand as a "professing" because that can imply pretending. Here, it means "to say a like word," or, as I like to say, "to agree with the Word."</p>

      <p>A similar form in Romans 10:10 states: "With the mouth, confession is made unto salvation."</p>

      <p>Your expectation will show itself in your speech and actions—your talk and walk. Everything you do will reveal whether you are expecting what God promised in His Word or doubting its fulfillment.</p>

      <p>Why hold fast? "For he is faithful that promised." You must speak what the Word says, not what circumstances, the economy, your spouse, friends, or neighbors say. This is a vital way to demonstrate your expectation.</p>

      <h2>Adventurously Expectant</h2>
      <p>'Wait anxiously for good' // Micah 1:12<br />
      Also, Romans 8:15-17 in the Message Bible describes this life: "This resurrection life you received from GOD is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a childlike "What's next, Papa?" GOD's Spirit touches our spirits and confirms who we are. We know who he is, and we know who we are: Father and children. And we know we are going to get what's coming to us—an unbelievable inheritance! We go through exactly what Christ goes through. If we go through the hard times with him, then we'll also go through the good times with him!"</p>

      <p>Notice the phrase "adventurously expectant." There's something about the art of expectation—it's about foreseeing miracles. Practice stretching forth your hands and asking, "What's next, Papa?"</p>

      <p>On its own, expectation puts you in a great place to receive. It fosters incurable optimism.<br />
      Expect greatness. It's happening. It's happening to me.</p>

    title: "Should Gospel Music Be Sold?",
    content: `
      <p class="lead">On the 7th of September, 2019, I sent a link of one of our songs to an old schoolmate who is a music minister, and his response was, 'Why should I buy?' He passively suggested I was a sinner for merchandising the gospel, and since then I have heard pockets of such condemning tongues calling out ministers who sell their songs.</p>

      <p>Here is one subject the church has major consternation over: many believers believe that the sales of gospel songs are a sinful act, as there are many believers who believe otherwise.</p>

      <p>Personally, I am not particular about which part of the divide you find yourself in. I am only saying do not paint others black because they don't adopt your practices. We must note that the very fact that some try to impose their convictions (which can be uninformed sometimes) is oppressive. Knowledge should breed compassion, not condemnation.</p>

      <p>I know it is not a sin, and in this piece, I will tell you why, not really with the intent that you start selling/buying gospel songs, but with the hope that we stop calling those who sell theirs devils.</p>

      <h2>Examining the Arguments</h2>
      
      <h3>Heaven's Admission Criteria</h3>
      <p>Firstly, I am certain that none of us will be admitted into heaven for not selling our songs. The Bible would have told us expressly. GOD loves us too much to hide such important criteria from us.</p>

      <h3>The Hypocrisy Factor</h3>
      <p>Secondly, I will suggest gently that we practice what we preach all the way. I remember a gentleman who opposes the sales of local gospel songs telling me how he used to buy Ron Kenoly's cassette back in the day to rehearse, and all I saw was hypocrisy. If you don't think gospel music should be sold, why buy it at all?</p>

      <h3>The Patriotism Question</h3>
      <p>There is a part of this that is just purely unpatriotic. Many who don't want local gospel music to be sold would buy a Travis Greene or Tye Tribbett's song but can't buy the song of someone who attended the same university with them. Perhaps GOD lives abroad.</p>

      <h3>Consistency in Conviction</h3>
      <p>There's another side to this too; the 'success has many friends' ideology. If you are opposed to the sales of gospel music, why not boycott meetings where those who sell their songs are the host or are invited to minister? Stand your campaigning rightly, boycott all Nathaniel Bassey's meetings. Tim Godfrey's next Fearless concert is a gated event; he is surely going to hell by your standard.</p>

      <p>Baba Chris Delvan, Pastor Chingtok Ishiaku, Frank Edwards, Sinach, Eben, Lara George, Nosa, Sammie Okposo, Mairo Ese, the list goes on...wait, why include their sold songs on your worship playlist in church? If you are boycotting the sales of gospel songs, please boycott completely.</p>

      <h3>The Piracy Problem</h3>
      <p>There is also the subject of piracy. If you don't adopt the thought that music should be sold, you must adopt the Bible's thought on theft. You should know that "Thou shalt not steal" is a central tenet of our faith, and the choice to steal people's content online in the form of downloading a pirated version of a song on sale is doing just that. Then sharing such stolen content on your WhatsApp is you initiating new thieves. If you don't want gospel music to be sold, please leave gospel music on sale alone.</p>

      <h2>The Biblical Foundation</h2>
      
      <h3>The Worker is Worthy</h3>
      <p>The Bible teaches that the one who is taught the Word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him. (Gal 6:6.) That means that people should give to support ministries that are blessing them spiritually. You know this gospel music will enrich you; why not share your good coins with the one who is enriching your spirit? This way, the needs of the music minister will be met, and he can continue with his ministry.</p>

      <p>One major factor not to forget is that the music minister is a preacher of the gospel too. As a pastor, I teach the word of God weekly, teaching/preaching, poetry, writings like this, and in some rare cases, singing. I have long known that music is an instrument of instruction, as there are many lessons that some will not get except through music. There are some who will not be open to learning without music too. This thought makes the music minister a preacher of the gospel. This doesn't take away the honour of a priest or the glory of the pastor.</p>

      <p>And the Bible dictates the labourer is worthy of his wages (Mt 10:10), and I particularly like how 1 Cor 9:14 puts it: "Even so, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel."</p>

      <h3>The Davidic Model</h3>
      <p>Now let us consider the one who was called the sweet Psalmist of Israel, King David, who established a professional, paid, and structured music ministry, ensuring temple musicians were supported through daily provisions, tithes, and offerings. These 288+ skilled musicians (1 Chronicles 25:6-7) were exempt from other duties to serve 24/7, and some interpretations suggest a massive, long-term investment in their sustenance.</p>

      <p>Nehemiah 11:23 notes that a royal command (likely from Artaxerxes) ensured daily, fixed provisions for the temple singers, highlighting the importance of sustained worship: "For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day." (Nehemiah 11:23 KJV)</p>

      <p>Many of us know a little of the sacrosanctity of the office of Levites in the Old Testament, but not many know that a lot of these Levites were actually musicians who ensured non-stop worship in the Temple; 1 Chronicles 11:33 hints there were 'those who were musicians, heads of Levite families, stayed in the rooms of the temple, and were exempt from other duties because they were responsible.'</p>

      <h2>The Historical Context</h2>
      <p>The church is primarily governed by non-market logic; there is no cost of admission, and primarily the choir isn't paid. However, as the years went by and the making of music got more technical and required more dedicated time, bands from churches started recording cassette tapes of their most popular songs and selling them to churchgoers, but these sales were mandated to be done outside the sanctuary.</p>

      <p>When these bands are invited to minister in other churches, churches did not pay them to sing, but the audience would take up a "love offering" for the group who came to sing. The concept of love-offering is still fought in many quarters as it is seen as financial compensation for a gospel and a gift these bands received freely.</p>

      <p>The growth of the influence of music in spiritual circles saw some bands charging an upfront fee to go to the churches that invited them, which sometimes is out of town. They were criticised for turning the house of GOD into the den of thieves. Others who didn't charge upfront only went to churches who had more love-offering to give. Of course, the popular notion was that they had let their "worldly" concern with money come in the way of their calling to sing by GOD.</p>

      <p>Many argue that they know that the rate at which these bands were invited across several towns, the band members won't be able to keep a regular job or run a business effectively, so the churches must be given a love-offering but they must not be paid. In other words, compensation was fine as long as it was optional and dependent on the hosting church.</p>

      <h2>A Personal Story</h2>
      <p>As a teenager, I led an Acappella band with three other fine brothers. On one occasion, we had been invited to minister in what I remember as a big church, and they gave us their standard. This required us to clean up. Some of us borrowed the clothes we wore. I borrowed money to buy what I wore. I had to look like 'the leader'. We transported ourselves as big boys (meaning we paid extra) to this all-night concert. When we were done, nobody gave us water to drink or the proverbial brown envelope, and we didn't have transport to go back home. We waited in the cold of day, stranded. So much for love offering!</p>

      <p>I have seen and read about old-time greats in the gospel music scene in this country who ended up broken and broke and desperately needed alms to see the next day. This does not have to be the case. Prov 12:27 tells us, "The lazy man does not roast what he took in hunting, But diligence is man's precious possession." This gift can be harnessed rightly in a way that provides for our grandchildren, and we don't have to lose our souls while at it. All that is required is wisdom.</p>

      <p>Many music ministers have lived from one love-offering to the next, getting into debt (giving the gospel we preach a terrible reputation) as they wait for their next church invitation. Why struggle when there is a system that puts a balance on the business side of music and the authenticity from our worship and protects our ministry gifts from strife and poverty?</p>

      <h2>Worship vs. The Tools of Worship</h2>
      <p>Worship is not for sale and never will be. It is not worship that is sold when gospel songs are sold; consider this: Christianity is not for sale, but we buy Bibles and other materials for the equipping of our faith. Likewise, worship is not for sale, but the tools like songs that aid our worship can be sold.</p>

      <p>Let's also consider the expertise and equipment that goes into the production of one good gospel song. The irredeemable hours too! Can people with other jobs produce good music on the side in their spare time? Yes! But research has shown that this can never be compared to experts who dedicate their lives to such craft. The excellence born out of such dedication always makes a difference and whatever side of the doctrinal divide you find yourself on, this holds true.</p>

      <h2>Learning from Hillsong</h2>
      <p>There is something to learn from Hillsong, they got a huge part of this right, they have professionals doing worship right and not worrying how their kids will go to school. And a licensing system is placed to protect the songwriters years after they are dead. They do this yet the worship is authentic. This tells you as long as your motive is in the right place, that is you are not in this for the money, the money that comes out of it will not be the driver or determinant of anything but the Spirit always.</p>

      <h2>The Heart Matter</h2>
      <p>Well, I have heard another argument on how it is allowed to charge our production and shipping costs but nothing over and above. What I understand from these is that as Paul warned "For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from GOD, we speak in Christ in the sight of GOD." (2Co 2:17). So as long as the minister has not become a degenerate and is not worshipping mammon, he can put a financial system in place to defend himself and keep the ministry afloat.</p>

      <p>Let's also consider what Peter said to Simon the sorcerer. "Peter answered: 'May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of GOD with money! You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before GOD. Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.'" (Ac 8:20-23). This again shows the gift of money is not the problem but the position of the heart.</p>

      <p>So the responsibility falls on the minister to subject himself to the leadership of the Holy Spirit, knowing he will give account of how he used the gift he was given by GOD. "So then each one of us will give an account of himself to GOD." (Rom 14:12). So let's not judge other people's intent.</p>

      <h2>A Word of Balance</h2>
      <p>If you are led to give out your materials for free (yes, the Holy Ghost does that when He chooses), please obey but don't make a doctrine out of it, knowing your personal instruction can't be the general practice.</p>

      <p>Lastly, I would like to put a balance here: the fact that I have argued in favour of the sales of Christian music doesn't also endorse the fact that there are young (mostly upcoming musicians) who rely solely on the sales of their songs for a livelihood. Please get a job, start a business if that is what soothes you best till your ministry is demanding enough and big enough to pay all your bills.</p>
